# AI & machine Learning Experiments

Experiment with AI & machine learning algorithms. I've always thought it would be fun to train games or build simulations and such. I've done that with programming but machine learning & AI is a step in the direction everyone else is going so there's no time like the present.

### Version 1.0.0.1

[versions](versions.md)

  

### Dependencies

Python 3.7+

[Python-Basic-Server](https://github.com/061375/Python-Basic-Server)

  

### Usage

1. Run python server from the Python-Basic-Server directory.

    py .\apiserver.py

2. Navigate to [http://localhost:35730/](http://localhost:35730/)
3. Currently you just play the game until it times out. Each time you lose the server records your game. The future plan is to use various algorithms to train the data and then allow the game to play itself.

## Goals

### Genetic Algorithm

#### Experiments

  

- Snake

- Built the snake game

- Built the logic to pass the data to the server

- Built the python to record the data

- Built the basic class to process the data

  

### NEAT

  

### Proximal Policy Optimization
